# WebSocket Connection Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the WebSocket connection system to address H15 "Idle connection" errors from Heroku.

## Background

The application was experiencing WebSocket disconnections due to Heroku's 55-second idle connection timeout policy. When a connection is kept open without data transfer for more than 55 seconds, Heroku terminates it with an H15 error.

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Client-Side Improvements

- Added a bidirectional heartbeat mechanism to the WebSocket context
- Implemented automatic reconnection with progressive backoff
- Enhanced error handling and connection status tracking
- Centralized WebSocket connection management through WebSocketContext

### 2. Server-Side Improvements

- Added server-side ping mechanism to all connected clients
- Implemented proper connection tracking and cleanup
- Added response handling for client-initiated pings
- Enhanced error handling and client disconnection management

## How It Works

1. **Client-Side Heartbeat**:
   - The WebSocketContext sends a ping message every 45 seconds (configurable)
   - This keeps the connection alive from the client side

2. **Server-Side Heartbeat**:
   - The server tracks all active connections
   - Every 45 seconds, it sends a ping to all connected clients
   - This prevents Heroku from closing idle connections

3. **Automatic Reconnection**:
   - If a connection is lost, the client automatically attempts to reconnect
   - Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the server
   - More aggressive reconnection logic with up to 10 attempts (configurable)

4. **Connection Status Tracking**:
   - Components can check connection status with `isConnected` property
   - WebSocket readyState is exposed for fine-grained status checks

## Testing the Connection

A test script has been provided to verify the WebSocket connection and heartbeat mechanism:

```bash
node test-websocket.js
```

This script:
1. Connects to the WebSocket server
2. Sends a ping message
3. Listens for pong responses and server pings
4. Reports on connection status periodically

Expected output will include:
- Connection confirmation
- Pong responses from the server (after pings)
- Server-side ping messages every 45 seconds
- Connection status updates every 15 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **H15 "Idle connection" errors still occurring**:
   - Check if the heartbeat interval is too long (should be under 55 seconds)
   - Verify both client and server-side ping mechanisms are working
   - Check for network issues that might block WebSocket traffic

2. **Frequent disconnections**:
   - Check server logs for error messages
   - Verify Heroku dyno is not sleeping (Eco dynos sleep after inactivity)

3. **Failed reconnections**:
   - Check server availability
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check browser console for WebSocket errors

### Heroku-Specific Configuration

For Heroku Eco Dynos:
- Dynos will sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity
- When a dyno sleeps, all WebSocket connections are lost
- The first HTTP request after sleep will wake the dyno, but WebSockets need to reconnect
- Consider implementing a ping service to keep dynos active during business hours

## Code Changes

The following files were modified to implement these improvements:

1. **src/contexts/WebSocketContext.js**:
   - Added heartbeat mechanism
   - Enhanced reconnection logic
   - Improved connection status tracking

2. **src/hooks/useWebSocket.js**:
   - Updated to use the centralized WebSocketContext
   - Added backward compatibility for existing code

3. **server.js**:
   - Added server-side ping mechanism
   - Implemented connection tracking
   - Added ping/pong message handling

4. **Components using WebSockets**:
   - Updated to use the improved WebSocket context
   - Enhanced error handling and connection status checks

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing WebSocket multiplexing to reduce the number of connections
2. Add more detailed logging and monitoring of WebSocket connections
3. Implement automatic retry for failed operations during disconnection periods
4. Consider using a more robust WebSocket library with built-in heartbeat and reconnection
