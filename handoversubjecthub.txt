Project: "Subject Hub" Feature for Enhanced Topic Management
Phase 1: Subject Hub Button & Basic Modal Structure (Conceptual)
New Component: SubjectHubModal.jsx
Purpose: A modal to display and manage topics for a selected subject.
Structure:
Receives isOpen, onClose, subjectData (name, existing topics, color), and placeholder action handlers (onAddTopic, onUpdateTopicPriority, onDeleteTopic).
Header displaying subject name and a close button.
Body with two main sections:
Topic List Section: Displays existing topics for the subject. Each topic item initially shows its name and placeholders for priority and a delete button.
Add New Topic Section: Initially a placeholder for a form to add new topics manually.
Footer with a "Done" button (calls onClose).
Styling: Basic CSS in SubjectHubModal.css for layout, overlay, header, sections, and buttons to ensure a clean and modern look.
Updates to FlashcardList.jsx (Conceptual)
Import: SubjectHubModal.
State:
isSubjectHubModalOpen (boolean) to control modal visibility.
selectedSubjectForHub (object) to store data of the subject whose hub is open (e.g., { name, id, topics, color }).
Functions:
openSubjectHubModal(subjectData): Sets selectedSubjectForHub with appropriately formatted data (extracting topic names/ids from groupedCards) and sets isSubjectHubModalOpen to true.
closeSubjectHubModal(): Resets the above state.
UI:
A new "Hub" button (e.g., ⚙️ icon) added to each subject header's action buttons.
Clicking this button calls openSubjectHubModal.
Rendering: SubjectHubModal is rendered conditionally based on isSubjectHubModalOpen and selectedSubjectForHub.
CSS: Added .hub-button class in FlashcardList.css for styling.
Phase 2: Topic Management in Subject Hub Modal (Conceptual & Partially Implemented in Files)
SubjectHubModal.jsx - Add New Topic UI:
Replaced placeholder with a stateful input field (newTopicName) and an "Add Topic" button.
Button calls onAddTopic(subjectData.name, newTopicName).
CSS for this form was added to SubjectHubModal.css.
FlashcardList.jsx - Add New Topic Logic:
handleAddNewTopicInHub(subjectName, newTopicName):
This function was defined.
It constructs a newShell object for the new topic with:
A preliminary unique id.
subject, topic (name), name (formatted).
type: 'topic', isShell: true, isEmpty: true.
topicPriority: 3 (default).
Calculated cardColor, subjectColor, topicColor (using generateShade and selectedSubjectForHub data).
Timestamps and basic examBoard/examType.
Calls onAddTopicShell(newShell) (prop from App.js).
Optimistically updates selectedSubjectForHub.topics to show the new topic in the modal immediately.
This handleAddNewTopicInHub function is passed as the onAddTopic prop to SubjectHubModal.
App.js - Add New Topic Logic (Manual Edits You Were Instructed to Make):
addTopicShell(newShellObject) function:
Adds the newShellObject to the allCards state (after ensuring ID uniqueness).
Updates the topicLists state to include/update the new topic.
Calls saveData(null, true) to persist changes.
This function is passed as onAddTopicShell prop to FlashcardList.
Delete Topic Functionality (Hub & Main List):
SubjectHubModal.jsx: The delete button for each topic calls onDeleteTopic(subjectData.name, topic.id || topic.name).
FlashcardList.jsx:
handleDeleteTopicInHub(subjectNameFromHub, topicIdOrName): This function was defined. It resolves the topic name and calls handleDeleteTopic. It also handles optimistic updates for the modal if it's open. This is passed as onDeleteTopic to SubjectHubModal.
handleDeleteTopic(subject, topic): Sets state to show the DeleteConfirmModal.
confirmDelete():
Prioritizes calling onDeleteTopicProp(parentSubject, itemToDelete) (this is handleDeleteTopicFromApp from App.js).
Has fallbacks to an older onDeleteTopic prop or a direct deleteTopic import.
Optimistically updates selectedSubjectForHub.topics if the hub modal is open.
App.js - Delete Topic Logic (Manual Edits You Were Instructed to Make):
handleDeleteTopicFromApp(subjectName, topicNameOrId) function:
Filters allCards to remove the specified topic (shell) and all its associated flashcards.
Updates topicLists to remove the topic.
Updates spacedRepetitionData to remove entries for the deleted cards.
Calls saveData(null, true).
This function is passed as onDeleteTopicProp to FlashcardList.
Old Delete Button: The individual delete button on each topic row in renderTopic within FlashcardList.jsx was to be hidden (commented out).
Phase 3: Topic Prioritization (Conceptual & Partially Implemented in Files)
Data Structure:
Confirmed topicPriority (defaulting to 0) exists on topic shells in the main data. This 0 will be treated as the default "Medium" priority (Level 3) for display purposes. User interactions save values 1-5.
SubjectHubModal.jsx - Priority UI:
PRIORITY_LEVELS constant defined with labels, icons, colors, and CSS classes.
State editingPriorityForTopic (string, topic ID) added to manage which topic's priority editor is active.
Each topic item in the list now:
Displays its current priority using an icon and color from PRIORITY_LEVELS. The full label appears on hover (tooltip style).
Clicking the priority display shows an inline "editor" with 5 buttons (one for each priority level, styled with its icon and color).
Clicking a priority button in the editor calls handleSetPriority(topic.id, newPriorityValue).
handleSetPriority(topicId, priorityValue): Calls onUpdateTopicPriority(subjectData.name, topicId, priorityValue) and closes the editor.
CSS for priority display, editor, and buttons added to SubjectHubModal.css.
FlashcardList.jsx - Priority Logic:
PRIORITY_LEVELS constant was added.
handleUpdateTopicPriorityInHub(subjectName, topicId, newPriority):
Calls onUpdateTopicPriorityProp(topicId, newPriority, subjectName) (prop from App.js).
Optimistically updates selectedSubjectForHub.topics with the new priority for immediate UI feedback in the modal.
This is passed as onUpdateTopicPriority to SubjectHubModal.
renderTopic: Updated to display the priority icon and label from PRIORITY_LEVELS in the topic's meta section in the main list.
CSS for the priority indicator in the list view added to FlashcardList.css.
App.js - Priority Update Logic (Manual Edits You Were Instructed to Make):
updateTopicShellPriority(topicId, newPriority, subjectName) function:
Finds the topic shell in allCards by topicId.
Updates its topicPriority and updatedAt fields.
Calls setAllCards to reflect this change.
Calls saveData(null, true).
This function is passed as onUpdateTopicPriorityProp to FlashcardList.
Build Errors Encountered and Addressed (Conceptually):
handleAddNewTopicInHub not defined in FlashcardList.jsx: Corrected by ensuring the function is defined.
React Hooks called conditionally in SubjectHubModal.jsx: Corrected by moving useState and useEffect calls before the early return.
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'Le' before initialization in FlashcardList.jsx during build: This points to a minified variable, often due to initialization order or dependency issues. The suggested temporary simplification of handleAddNewTopicInHub (removing generateShade call) was a diagnostic step.
