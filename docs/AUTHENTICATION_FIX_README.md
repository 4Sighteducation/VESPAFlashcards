# Authentication and Card Storage Fix

This document outlines the changes made to fix the issues with card addition and authentication in the VESPAFlashcards application.

## Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Issues**: 403 errors in API calls due to invalid or expired tokens
2. **Token Refresh Problems**: Multiple consecutive token refresh requests without proper response handling
3. **Message Synchronization**: Multiple APP_READY messages and SAVE_DATA requests creating race conditions
4. **Metadata Loss**: Exam type and exam board not being correctly preserved during card generation
5. **UI Recovery**: Initialization screen getting stuck after card operations

## Files Modified

1. **knack-message-handler.js**: 
   - Enhanced token refresh mechanism
   - Added centralized message handling
   - Improved error handling for API calls
   - Added initialization code for message handlers

2. **AICardGenerator.jsx**:
   - Fixed token refresh request function with better retry logic
   - Enhanced handleAddCard with improved metadata handling
   - Fixed operation tracking to prevent duplicate API calls
   - Added resetAfterCardOperation to recover from stuck states

## Key Improvements

### Authentication Flow

- Added proper token refresh mechanism with acknowledgment
- Implemented retry logic for API calls with exponential backoff
- Added explicit log messages for debugging authentication issues
- Ensured fresh tokens are used for verification

### Metadata Preservation

- Captured stable references to metadata (examType, examBoard, subject, topic)
- Ensured metadata is explicitly passed in all API calls
- Added validation to detect and fix missing metadata
- Created a consistent pattern for metadata handling across functions

### Race Condition Prevention

- Added operation tracking with flags to prevent duplicate API calls 
- Implemented staggered updates with appropriate timeouts
- Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Enhanced message passing with explicit parameters

### Self-Healing Behavior

- Added resetAfterCardOperation for automatic recovery
- Implemented monitoring of card operations with auto-reset
- Added explicit error handling for all async operations
- Ensured proper state cleanup after operations

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. Generate cards with examBoard and examType specified
2. Add cards to the bank individually or using "Add All"
3. Verify that metadata (examBoard, examType, etc.) is preserved
4. Confirm no initialization screen issues after adding cards
5. Check network requests to ensure no 403 errors

## Technical Notes

These changes focus on making the application more robust by adding:

- Better state management during asynchronous operations
- Explicit error handling with proper user feedback
- Self-healing capabilities to recover from edge cases
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting
