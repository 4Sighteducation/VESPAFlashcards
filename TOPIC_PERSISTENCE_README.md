# Topic List Persistence Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement addresses the issue of topic lists disappearing during autosave operations or page refreshes. The solution implements a robust multi-layered persistence mechanism that preserves topic lists even when the backend system overwrites them unexpectedly.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-layer Persistence**:
   - Memory cache (RAM) for immediate access
   - Session storage for page refresh protection
   - Regular server saves for long-term storage

2. **Mobile-responsive UI**:
   - New TopicListSummary component with responsive design
   - Better touch targets for mobile users
   - Flexible layout that adjusts to different screen sizes

3. **Enhanced Architecture**:
   - Separation of concerns between data and UI components
   - TopicListSyncManager handles data synchronization
   - TopicsPersistenceManager provides resilient storage
   - TopicListSummary offers a cleaner, more focused UI

## How It Works

When topic changes occur:

1. Topics are immediately saved to an in-memory cache
2. Topics are simultaneously backed up to session storage
3. When server save operations complete successfully, the cache is cleared
4. If a save operation fails, the cached data remains as a backup
5. On page load/refresh, the system first checks for cached topics before using server data
6. This ensures topic lists remain visible even if server data is incomplete or overwritten

## Recovery Process

If an autosave overwrites topic lists:

1. The system automatically restores them from the session storage cache
2. The next successful save will properly persist them to the server

This means users will no longer lose their topic lists when the app autosaves or when refreshing the page.

## Technical Notes

- Using git tag `topic-modal-original` to reference the previous implementation
- Created on branch `topic-modal-refactor` 
- Replaced old `TopicListModal.jsx` and `TopicListModal.css` with new components
- Added `browser.beforeunload` event handler to protect against browser close/refresh
