Find the current {examBoard} {examType} {subject} specification for the {academicYear} academic year using these approaches in order:

1. FIRST ATTEMPT: Official source websites:
   - AQA: https://www.aqa.org.uk/
   - Edexcel/Pearson: https://qualifications.pearson.com/
   - OCR: https://www.ocr.org.uk/
   - WJEC/Eduqas: https://www.wjec.co.uk/ or https://www.eduqas.co.uk/
   - SQA: https://www.sqa.org.uk/

2. IF OFFICIAL SPECIFICATION IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE:
   - Look for official topic lists or syllabus summaries
   - Check for teacher resources that list the full curriculum
   - Review past papers to identify main topic areas
   - Search for official revision guides or textbooks aligned with the current specification

3. IF STILL UNCERTAIN:
   - Use the most recent verified information available
   - Make note of the source and year in the error message

IMPORTANT: Each exam board uses different terminology and qualification levels. Normalize their structure as follows:

EXAM BOARD TERMINOLOGY:
- AQA: Extract from Units/Topics into main topics and subtopics
- Edexcel: Extract from Themes/Topics into main topics and subtopics
- OCR: Extract from Modules/Topics into main topics and subtopics
- WJEC/Eduqas: Extract from Themes/Areas of study into main topics and subtopics
- SQA: Extract from Outcomes/Assessment standards into main topics and subtopics

QUALIFICATION LEVELS:
- A Level: Advanced level qualifications (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland)
- AS Level: First year of A Level studies (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland)
- GCSE: General Certificate of Secondary Education (England, Wales, and Northern Ireland)
- National 5: Scottish equivalent to GCSE (Scotland)
- Higher: Scottish equivalent to AS Level (Scotland)
- Advanced Higher: Scottish equivalent to A Level (Scotland)
- BTEC Level 2: Equivalent to GCSE (vocational qualification)
- BTEC Level 3: Equivalent to A Level (vocational qualification)
- Cambridge National Level 2: Equivalent to GCSE (vocational qualification)
- Cambridge National Level 3: Equivalent to A Level (vocational qualification)
- International Baccalaureate: Look for specific subject guides in the IB curriculum

HANDLING OPTIONAL TOPICS:
1. Mark optional topics with "[Optional]" prefix in both mainTopic and subtopic fields
2. For optional topics that belong to specific groups, use "[Optional - Group X]" format
3. NEVER use formats like "Option 1:" - always use "[Optional]" prefix instead
4. Include ALL optional topics/routes in your response - do not omit any content

Extract ONLY main topics and their immediate subtopics in this exact format:
[
  {
    "id": "1.1",  // Simple sequential numbering
    "topic": "Main Topic: Subtopic",  // Combined for display
    "mainTopic": "Main Topic",  // The primary topic area only
    "subtopic": "Subtopic"  // First-level subtopic only
  },
  ...
]

RULES:
1. FLATTEN THE HIERARCHY - only include two levels: main topics and their immediate subtopics
2. NORMALIZE TERMINOLOGY - use "main topics" and "subtopics" regardless of the exam board's specific terminology
3. PRESERVE EXACT SUBTOPIC STRUCTURE - If the specification lists items as separate subtopics, keep them separate. If listed as a single subtopic with multiple elements, keep as one subtopic. Do not split or combine subtopics differently than shown in the official specification.
4. HANDLE COMPOUND SUBTOPICS - When a subtopic contains multiple elements separated by commas or "and" (e.g., "Daily life, cultural life and festivals"), preserve it exactly as written in the specification without splitting.
5. CONSISTENT NUMBERING - Use simple sequential numbering (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.) regardless of the original specification
6. NO DUPLICATES - Each combination of main topic and subtopic should appear only once
7. CLEAN OUTPUT - The response must be ONLY the JSON array - no explanations or other text

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. ONLY return the JSON array - absolutely no text before or after
2. Ensure proper JSON syntax with double quotes around keys and string values
3. No trailing commas after the last item in arrays or objects
4. Each topic must have all required fields: id, topic, mainTopic, subtopic

ERROR HANDLING:
If you cannot find the specific syllabus, return: 
[{"error": "Could not find current {examBoard} {examType} {subject} specification", 
  "source": "Describe what sources you checked",
  "alternative": "USE AI Fallback Function"}]

// Example output for AQA A Level Physics (partial):
[
  {
    "id": "1.1", 
    "topic": "Measurements and their errors: Use of SI units and their prefixes",
    "mainTopic": "Measurements and their errors",
    "subtopic": "Use of SI units and their prefixes"
  },
  {
    "id": "1.2",
    "topic": "Measurements and their errors: Limitations of physical measurements", 
    "mainTopic": "Measurements and their errors",
    "subtopic": "Limitations of physical measurements"
  }
]
