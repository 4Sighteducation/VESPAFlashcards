Generate 5 high-quality AQA A-Level Biology flashcards for the specific topic "Cells: Cell Structure".
Make these appropriate for A-Level students (age 16-18). Questions should be challenging and involve deeper thinking. Include sufficient detail in answers and use appropriate technical language.

Before generating questions, scrape the latest AQA A-Level Biology specification to ensure the content matches the current curriculum exactly.

Use this format for different question types:

  {
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Cells: Cell Structure",
    "questionType": "multiple_choice",
    "question": "Which of the following organelles is primarily involved in the synthesis of lipids and detoxification of drugs and poisons?",
    "options": ["Rough endoplasmic reticulum", "Smooth endoplasmic reticulum", "Golgi apparatus", "Lysosome"],
    "correctAnswer": "Smooth endoplasmic reticulum",
    "detailedAnswer": "The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in the synthesis of lipids, including phospholipids and cholesterol, which are essential components of cell membranes. It also plays a crucial role in detoxifying drugs and poisons by metabolizing them into water-soluble compounds that can be easily excreted from the cell. Unlike the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the SER lacks ribosomes on its surface, which are responsible for protein synthesis."
  },

    "subject": "Biology",

    "question": "Which component of the cytoskeleton is responsible for the movement of chromosomes during cell division?",
    "options": ["Microfilaments", "Intermediate filaments", "Microtubules", "Actin filaments"],
    "correctAnswer": "Microtubules",
    "detailedAnswer": "Microtubules are hollow tubes composed of tubulin proteins and are a key component of the cytoskeleton. They are essential for the separation of chromosomes during cell division, forming the mitotic spindle that aligns and separates sister chromatids. Microtubules also provide structural support and facilitate intracellular transport."
  },
  {
    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Cells: Cell Structure",
    "questionType": "multiple_choice",
    "question": "What is the main function of the nucleolus within the eukaryotic nucleus?",
    "options": ["DNA replication", "Ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome assembly", "Protein modification", "Lipid synthesis"],
    "correctAnswer": "Ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome assembly",
    "detailedAnswer": "The nucleolus is a dense region within the nucleus where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and combined with proteins to form the subunits of ribosomes. These subunits are then transported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they assemble into functional ribosomes, the sites of protein synthesis. The nucleolus plays no direct role in DNA replication, protein modification, or lipid synthesis."

    "question": "Which of the following is a feature of eukaryotic cells but not prokaryotic cells?",
    "options": ["Plasma membrane", "DNA", "Nucleus", "Ribosomes"],
    "correctAnswer": "Nucleus",
    "detailedAnswer": "Eukaryotic cells are characterized by the presence of a nucleus, a membrane-bound organelle that contains the cell's genetic material. Prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria, lack a true nucleus; instead, their DNA is located in a region called the nucleoid. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane, DNA, and ribosomes, but the nucleus is exclusive to eukaryotes."

    "subject": "Biology",
    "topic": "Cells: Cell Structure",

    "question": "Which cellular structure is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins for secretion or delivery to other organelles?",
    "options": ["Endoplasmic reticulum", "Golgi apparatus", "Lysosome", "Mitochondrion"],
    "correctAnswer": "Golgi apparatus",
    "detailedAnswer": "The Golgi apparatus, also known as the Golgi complex, is a series of flattened membrane-bound sacs that modify, sort, and package proteins and lipids for secretion or delivery to different parts of the cell. Proteins and lipids are received from the endoplasmic reticulum, undergo further modifications, and are then tagged for their specific destinations. This organelle is crucial for maintaining cellular organization and facilitating communication within the cell."
